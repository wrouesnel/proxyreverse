# ProxyReverse

ProxyReverse is a very simple reverse proxy implementation that can proxy to servers
which are themselves behind an HTTP forward proxy.

This is a common annoyance with corporate firewalls, and a nuisance to solve with
standard tools.

## Usage

```shell
proxyreverse reverse-proxy
```
